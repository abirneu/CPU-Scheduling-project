# CPU-Scheduling-project
It was my 3rd year 2nd semester Operating System lab project. I tried to make a simple project for four CPU scheduling processes. I use only one function for this code. User input is read from the file, then stored in variable.
When one scheduling process runs, the output of this process is shown, and those results are stored in another file. This process will continue for four CPU scheduling processes.
